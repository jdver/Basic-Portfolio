    <img src="./assets/images/me.jpg" alt="My Picture">

    <p>Hello World, I am Jose Vera and am a young working-professional who is now attending Coding Bootcamp at UC Berkeley Extension to learn some new skills and hopefully change career industries. Most of my career background has been in higher education, which I have enjoyed and learned a lot from. I have a great sense of fulfillment helping students navigate their college careers. After being in the field for several years, I now have a desire to explore other options, and coding sounded like the most exciting and rewarding. I am excited by how many diverse job opportunities are available as a web developer, and look forward to beginning a new career.</p>
